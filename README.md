This paper consists of a literature review of various models for emotional architecture
and decision making. It follows with a new model, the Profile Model, based on current
research. It will then present how the various components within the model interact to
make a decision. The potential for further work stemming from this model will be
discussed, as well as the importance of defining and modeling emotion.
